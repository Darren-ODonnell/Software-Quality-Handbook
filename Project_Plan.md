# Project Plan

 

**Task Estimation in Scrum (Adam & Darren)**

\-     Estimation Matrix: Time, Difficulty & Extent of unknowns

\-     Planning Poker: Each scrum member puts forward a value, average is taken as the story points for the story being estimated.

 

**Code Reviews (Connor & Adam)**

\-     Attention to traditional conventions and patterns

\-     Reusing previously created/tested methods rather than creating anew

 

**Additional Topic: Testing / Test Coverage (Darren & Connor)**

\-     Unit Testing

\-     Integration Testing

\-     Mocking

\-     End-To-End Testing

 

**Future Plan**

\-     Get a list of more specific topics under our main headings

\-     Split each section into tasks for individual contributors

\-     Execute on assigned tasks

\-     Merge changes with co-contributor

\-     Assess end result and apply formatting

 



 

2nd Meeting: Assigning Tasks

**Task Estimation (Adam / Darren)**

\-     Planning poker

\-     Estimation matrix

\-     Affinity Estimation

\-     Benefits: Improved planning and prioritization, transparency and collaboration

\-     Limitations: Time-consuming and lack of action. Lack of accuracy, unknowns obscuring time-frame.

\-     Break down larger tasks

\-     Roughly estimate items further down the backlog

\-     Use a variety of estimation techniques: top-down estimate, bottom-up estimate, analogous estimating, parametric estimate, three-point estimating, and what-if analysis

\-     3 amigos, involve QA, front-end and back-end in full vertical slice meetings

\-     Don’t rely solely on estimates.

\-     Use story points

\-     “Just enough” documentation

**Code Review (Connor / Adam)**

\-     Reusing code

\-     Importance of code reviews

\-     Code-review checklist

\-     Code review tools and technologies

\-     Patterns and Architecture / Software Quality

\-     Process for fixing issues on code reviews.

\-     Proper communication: The code is wrong instead of you are wrong

\-     Effectiveness of code reviews

\-     Monthly check-ins to deal with recurring problems

\-     Standards on what the code review is trying to achieve.

\-     Best practices of code review

\-     Meetings around coding practices in a larger dev group, where outside teams can share personal experiences.

**Testing (Darren / Connor)**

\-     Test one thing at a time

\-     Test edge cases and flows

\-     Quality Control processes

\-     Clear and concise test cases

\-     Quick sanity checks before overnight regression testing 

\-     Ensure smooth integration with other components

\-     Adhere to a test-coverage guideline.

\-     Ensure the tests accurately describe the function they are validating

\-     Ensure the tests do not have obsolete functionality

\-     Mock other aspects of the test which are not directly being tested currently
