**Testing**

Testing is vital within software engineering for ensuring a program fulfils its’ intended purpose. Testing enables the programmer to have confidence that his future changes have not caused issues with work prior. 

Some general guidelines for ensuring code quality through testing are as follows:

\-     Test one thing at a time. Tests should be as granular as possible. This ensures that what you are testing will not be disrupted by other methods which are the cause of error. Testing should begin with the most granular section, with the least dependencies. ![img](file:///C:/Users/Darren/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.png)

 

\-     Be diligent towards testing edge cases: This is done because edge cases are the most common culprit resulting in errors. An example of an edge case is having an exam result where if <= 40 would result in a fail and the provided result was 40, declaring the grade as a pass.

 

\-     Ensure that all developers involved in the feature being tested are aware of the full scope of how this feature needs to work and how it will integrate with the wider system. This provides greater frame of references for people to debug future issues arising as a result of any unsuspected errors resulting from this feature.

 

\-     Make sure to do quick sanity checks before kicking off a long-winded regression test. These should also be done at night so they don’t eat into your working hours.

**Task Estimation in Scrum**

Task estimation is a crucial Scrum procedure that aids the team in efficiently planning and monitoring their work. It involves teams estimating how much time tasks will need to be completed and divides the larger tasks into smaller ones. Task estimation aids in the team's development of a realistic Sprint plan, early detection of potential obstacles or dependencies, and transparency regarding the work that needs to be done.

Planning Poker

Planning poker is a collaborative technique used in agile software development to estimate the effort and complexity required for each task or user story. The main purpose of this is to promote collaboration between team members and provide more accurate estimations. 

The general steps to follow to use Planning Poker effectively include: 

-	Inviting all teams members to participate during the scrum meeting
-	Use a deck of playing cards with corresponding values.
-	Each team member chooses a card that corresponds to their estimation.
-	Talk about and resolve any discrepancies in estimations.
-	Continue until a decision is reached.

Some of the main challenges involved in Planning Poker are allowing team members to dominate the discussion and rushing the final descion and not taking the time to reconcile different estimates.

Benefits and Limitations

Benefits

Improved Decision Making – breaks down work items into smaller tasks, allowing the team to develop a realistic strategy for the sprint, make appropriate plans, and have a clear understanding of the amount of work to be done.

Increased Transparency - provides visibility into the work required for each job in the Sprint Backlog, enabling the team to identify potential obstacles and dependencies early and take proactive measures to overcome them.

Other Benefits Include:
-	Enhanced collaboration
-	Improved productivity
-	Better Risk Management
-	More accurate forecasting

Limitations

Inaccuracy: Task estimation in Scrum is subject to inaccuracy due to various factors such as unforeseen obstacles, unexpected delays, or changes in requirements, leading to a potential mismatch between planned and actual work completed during a Sprint.

Inflexibility: It may also result in inflexibility when it becomes difficult to adjust an estimate due to unexpected complexities or changes, leading to a lack of adaptability to changing circumstances.

Other Limitations include:
-	Focus on time instead of value
-	Time-consuming
-	Over-reliance on estimation
-	One Sit All Estimation
